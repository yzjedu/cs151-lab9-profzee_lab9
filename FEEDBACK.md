### Blind Test: Running the code

| Result     | Description                                                                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **YES-NO** | Asks the user for an input file name                                                    |
| **YES-NO** | Asks user to try again if input file name doesn't exist (try `bbb.txt`)                 |
| **YES-NO** | Works  with `yalew.txt`, `sibren.txt`, and `nweke.txt`. |
| **YES-NO** | The number of tables should be the length of file divided by 5 |
| **YES-NO** | Try all three files again. Each table should have 5 people at each table                |
| **YES-NO** | Output of assignments has `~~~~~` lines between each, or something similar              |
| **YES-NO** | For each person, it lists Table number, Seat number, Name                               |

### Open Test: Looking at the code

| Result     | Description                                                                              |

| **YES-NO** | Purpose of the program is clearly stated |  
| **YES-NO** | There is at least one for loop in the code                                              |
| **YES-NO** | All loops except for error checking on user input is a loop                             |
| **YES-NO** | Error checking on user input `filename` with  `while os.path.isfile(filename)` |
| **YES-NO** | There is a function for error checking file name that returns file name                 |
| **YES-NO** | There is a function for reading from the file that returns a list of names              |
| **YES-NO** | There is a function for determining and outputting table assignments                    |
